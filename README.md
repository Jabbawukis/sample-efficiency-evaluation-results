# Sample Efficiency Evaluation Results

## Overview

For every model:
- extract probing results in `probing_results_on_checkpoints` files into a `checkpoint_extracted` directory within the same 
parent directory
- extraxt the `increasing_occurrences_in_slices.tar.xz` file in the same parent directory
